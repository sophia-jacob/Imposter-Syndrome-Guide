## Inspiration
I was inspired to create a project on Imposter Syndrome, as soon as I realized that 9%-82% people are experiencing Imposter Syndrome. And I wanted to make a difference in the world, by creating a website called, "Imposter Syndrome Guide".

## What it does
I created a website with multiple pages. The home page talks about my mission, and my goal for creating this website. I have also included a page where you can let go of all your stress by writing freely. Another page that I find really helpful, is the Check-in page. And this allows you to check-in with yourself. I have also included a map that recommends some Wellness Center's near you!

## How I built it
I used HTML and CSS to create this project! For brainstorming, I wrote down all the ideas on a Google Doc. Some ideas I had to brainstorm were; the color scheme, the font, the design, etc....

## Challenges we ran into
I ran into many challenges while creating this website. Some of the challenges I ran into were how to create a parallax effect while scrolling up and down the home page. While creating this website, I was also a little confused on how to attach a map that gave you recommendations. Luckily, I was able to overcome my challenges I faced, with help from online resources and mentors, as well as remembering some coding experience that I have.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud of the design that the website has. I also really like the wonderful effects I've added such as the gradient background, the navbar style, and the buttons. I also do like the website in general, as it did turn out to be similarly to how I had planned it to be like.

## What we learned
I learned how to create awesome gradient background colors, as I only knew how to create websites with plain background, before attending this hackathon. Something else that I also learned was how to create a wonderfully designed Navbar.

## What's next for Imposter Syndrome Guide
If I had more time to work on this website, I would try to learn how to embed a JavaScript form that would allow the users to input what type of Imposter Syndrome they are going through, and what exactly they are going through. I would hope to have the form give them an immediate response, with some suggestions, as well as some solutions!
